# oEmbed Plugin for Moodle Atto Editor
========================================

This plugin enables you to embed media content in the atto editor
using oembed. The list of content providers supported by this plugin
is available here: http://oembed.com/providers.json.

New content providers are added as they apear in this list.

Base for this plug-in was moodle-atto_newtemplate made by Justin Hunt.
It is available at GitHub https://github.com/justinhunt/moodle-atto_newtemplate.

The php code doing the actual magic is based on moodle-filter_oembed maintained by Mike Churchward, James McQuillan, Vinayak (Vin) Bhalerao, Josh Gavant and Rob Dolin.
It is available at GitHub https://github.com/MSOpenTech/moodle-filter_oembed.

Many thanks for that!

My biggest thanks go to Guy Thomas from Moodlerooms for his endless help and inspiration for this plugin.

I would also like to thank Miriam Kunst (University of applied Sciences LÃ¼beck) for designing the icon and also the organizers of the Moodle DevCamp 2015 in Vienna.

More documentation coming soon!
