oEmbed Plugin for Moodle Atto Editor
========================================

This plugin enables you to embed media content in the atto editor
using oembed. The list of content providers supported by this plug.in
is available here: http://oembed.com/providers.json

New content providers are added as they apear in this list.

Base for this plug-in was moodle-atto_newtemplate made by Justin Hunt.
It is available at GitHub https://github.com/justinhunt/moodle-atto_newtemplate.

The php code doing the actual magic is based on moodle-filter_oembed maintained by Mike Churchward, James McQuillan, Vinayak (Vin) Bhalerao, Josh Gavant and Rob Dolin.

It is available at GitHub https://github.com/MSOpenTech/moodle-filter_oembed.

Many thanks for that!

My biggest thanks go to Guy Thomas for his endless help and insperation for this plugin.

More documentation coming soon!
