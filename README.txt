Template for new Atto plugins for Moodle
========================================

The following steps should get you up and running with
this module template code.

* Unzip the archive and read this file. (so far so good eh)

* Rename the oembed/ folder to the name of your module (eg "widget").
  The plugin folder MUST be lower case and can't contain underscores.
  You should check the Moodle plugin repository at
  https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=category&id=53 to confirm that
  the name you wish to use isn't already in use.
  Registering the plugin name at http://moodle.org/plugins will secure it
  for you.

* Edit all the files in this directory and its subdirectories and change
  all the instances of the string "oembed" to your atto plugin name
  (eg "widget"). Don't do this manually. Use an IDE or a programmers text
  editor like TextWrangler (mac) or Notepad++ (pc)
  If you are using Linux, you could also use the following command
  $ find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/oembed/widget/g' {} \;

  On a mac, use:
  $ find . -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/oembed/widget/g' {} \;

* Rename the file lang/en/atto_oembed.php to lang/en/atto_widget.php
  where "widget" is the name of your atto plugin

* Place the plugin folder folder into the /lib/editor/atto/plugins folder of the moodle
  directory.

* Modify version.php and set the initial version of your module.

* Visit Settings > Site Administration > Notifications, and let Moodle guide you through the install.

* Go to Site Administration > Plugins > Text Editors > Atto Toolbar Settings
  and you should find that this plugin has been added to the list of
  installed modules.
  IMPORTANT: Now add the name of your plugin to the menu structure near the bottom of the page
  e.g style1 = title, bold, italic, widget
  (where widget is the name of your atto plugin)
  
* You will need to generate the js for your editor icon button. 
  Your icon won't even show on the editor until you have done this.
  The source for the button is at yui/src/button/js/button.js
  Changes to button.js won't do anything until you have run "shifter" over them.
  Once you have everything set up to run shifter, go to the folder with build.json in it,
  probably: yui/src/button
  then type "shifter" , hopefully you don't get errors (lots of warnings are normal)
  See:  http://docs.moodle.org/dev/YUI/Shifter

* You may now proceed to run your own code in an attempt to develop
  your module.

Good luck!
